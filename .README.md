# expressionDate

Set of expressions aimed at solving common date-related operations: 
parse, format, compare, validate, manipulate (e.g. move forward, move back).
Most (if not all) operations are based on and built with [`Luxon`](https://github.com/moment/luxon/) `DateTime`. If not stated otherwise, date operations return a `string` in ISO 8601 format (`2021-01-27T20:38:12.807Z`).

```
npm install @orioro/expression-date
yarn add @orioro/expression-date
```
